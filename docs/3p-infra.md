Third-party infrastructure
==========================

We run lots of our own infrastructure, but there's some infrastructure that's a lot of work and it's just easier to get someone else to do it for us. This is a list of the third-party services we use, and the people responsible for those accounts.


Github
------

Owners: rrix, flamsmark

We use Github for everything. Ryan and Tom are owners of the organization.


Slack
-----

Owners: flamsmark, rrix

Slack is for realtime chat and a shared online space. Tom is the primary owner, and Ryan is an administrator.


Twitter
-------

Owners: flamsmark

Only Tom knows the password to @nil_sf. It'd be neat to have a shared way to operate the account.


NearlyFreeSpeech
----------------

Owners: flamsmark

Our website is hosted on NearlyFreeSpeech.net and they also forward email for the <contact@nortonimperiallabs.org> address.


Gandi
-----

Owners: flamsmark, rrix

The <nortonimperiallabs.org> domain is registered with Gandi, and the host our DNS servers. Tom registered the domain, and Ryan is a technical contact who can change settings.


Mailchimp
---------

Owners: flamsmark

Tom set up a Mailchimp account and list. 


IRC Channel (#sfnil on Freenode)
--------------------------------

* Owners: rrix, niacin, flamsmark, asmallteapot
